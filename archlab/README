1. Building the Y86-64 tools
*************************

The Y86-64 simulators can be configured to support TTY and GUI
interfaces. A simulator running in TTY mode prints all information
about its run-time behavior on the terminal.  It's harder to understand what's
going on, but useful for automated testing, and doesn't require any
special installation features.  A simulator running in GUI mode uses a
fancy graphical user interface.  Nice for visualizing and debugging,
but requires installation of Tcl/Tk on your system.

To build the Y86-64 tools, perform the following step:

      Linux> make clean; make

      This file

misc/   
      Source files for the Y86-64 assembler yas, the Y86-64
      instruction simulator yis, and the isa.c file that is used by
      the -t option of the processor simulators to check the results
      against the ISA simulation.  Also contains files for the
      programs hcl2c and hcl2v.

seq/    
      Code for the SEQ and SEQ+ simulators.  Contains HCL files for
      labs and homework problems that involve modifying SEQ.

pipe/   
      Code for the PIPE simulator.  Contains HCL files for labs and
      homework problems that involve modifying PIPE.

y86-code/
      Example .ys files from CS:APP and scripts for conducting
      automated benchmark teseting of the new processor designs.

ptest/
      Automated regression testing scripts for testing processor
      designs.
